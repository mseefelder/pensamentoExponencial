## Pensamento exponencial e *Open Source Software*

Analogia do viajante do tempo.

Crescimento exponencial da capacidade computacional: exemplos, curva S e chips 3D **(after moore's law ?)**

Crescimento exponencial do acesso: exemplos

Open Source Software: crescimento

OSS: potencial e casos de uso

"...the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale."
"... we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure, where things like business definition and even industry definition are actually the outcomes of strategy, not something that the strategy presupposes."
"...we need to work out how to accommodate collaboration and competition simultaneously. We need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously. And we need industry structures that will accommodate very, very different motivations, from the amateur motivations of people in communities (think Wikipedia) to maybe the social motivations of infrastructure built by governments, or, for that matter, cooperative institutions built by companies that are otherwise competing, because that is the only way that they can get to scale."

“In order for someone to be transported into the future and die from the level of shock they’d experience, they have to go enough years ahead that a “die level of progress,” or a Die Progress Unit (DPU) has been achieved. So a DPU took over 100,000 years in hunter-gatherer times, but at the post-Agricultural Revolution rate, it only took about 12,000 years. The post-Industrial Revolution world has moved so quickly that a 1750 person only needs to go forward a couple hundred years for a DPU to have happened.”

"(...) There is not the slightest reason to believe in a coming singularity. The fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence that it is likely or even possible. Look at domed cities, jet-pack commuting, underwater cities, mile-high buildings, and nuclear-powered automobiles—all staples of futuristic fantasies when I was a child that have never arrived. Sheer processing power is not a pixie dust that magically solves all your problems. (...)"

"The impact is further amplified when technologies coalesce into open platforms and ecosystems. These reduce the investment and lead time required to drive the next wave of innovation into markets by enabling people and technologies to rapidly build on previous waves of innovation. "

"Through a virtuous cycle—technological improvement enabling innovation, which in turn serves as a platform for further technological improvement and innovation—exponentially advancing technologies lead to exponentially accelerating innovation. For companies, this accumulation of technological advances, and the consequent layering of innovation upon innovation, can pose the hreat of disruption—but can also open the door to great opportunity. And the technologies show no sign of stabilizing."

"Open source improves efficiency, interoperability, and innovation according to the latest open source survey from North Bridge and Black Duck.(...)results show open source as “today’s preeminent architecture, the foundation for nearly all applications, operating systems, cloud computing, databases, and big data,”(...)"

"Looking ahead, respondents say that, in the next 2-3 years, the main revenue-generating business models for open source vendors will be: software-as-a-service (46 percent); custom development (42 percent), and services/support (41 percent). "
